SQL databases are seen as innefficient.
- the guy goes over "normalization" which splits the table into MANY tables
    and it becomes starts to require complex queries.
- this is why NoSQL comes into play

NoSQL is "non-relational" and is often used in big data applications.
- it also support "non-structured data".
- more flexible
- uses object-based API's for interaction as opposed to straight SQL.
